# Unsupervised-Machine_Learning_Customer_Market_Segmentation
In this project, we trained an unsupervised machine learning algorithm to perform bank customer segmentation. This project could be practically applied at any marketing department in the banking and retail industries to segment customers into 'clusters' or 'groups'. We build K-mean unsupervised machine learning algorithm in Scikit Learn to perform customer segmentation. In this project, we completed the following tasks:

Task 1: Understand the problem statement and business case    

Task 2: Import libraries and datasets    

Task 3: Visualize and explore datasets    

Task 4: Understand the theory and intuition behind k-means clustering machine learning algorithm    

Task 5: Learn how to obtain the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method    

Task 6: Use Scikit-Learn library to find the optimal number of clusters using elbow method    

Task 7: Apply k-means using Scikit-Learn to perform customer segmentation    

Task 8: Apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique to perform dimensionality reduction and data visualization
